<h2>Self-Introduction</h2>

<p id="forpary"> Hi everyone, My name is Brandon Miranda, I'm a senior software engineering major here at ECU and from Goldsboro NC.
    As far as background goes, I've been coding with Python mainly, but I also have experience using R for data visualization and R-Markdown for creating webpages.
    I chose software engineering as my major because I've always been a computer person and growing up until now, I've always loved playing video games and making music on computer programs,
    so it was a matter of time until I decided to learn the ins and outs of what I enjoy doing. I wanted to take this class because once I graduate, I plan on either becoming a back-end or full stack engineer,
    and this course I feel will prepare me and help me make some worthwhile projects worth sharing with potential suitors. 
    
    <br>For people looking for a group, I have somewhat of a busy schedule like the rest of you, but I pride myself on being as available as I can be for all the groups I've been a part of.
    I'm free on weekends and during the week almost every afternoon and I don't mind working late into the AM either whether it's a group or solo task. So, feel free to message me I love working with hard working groups and meeting new people. </p>
